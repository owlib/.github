# ü¶â Optimzed Workflow Library (OWL)

**A library of optimzed, composable, and promptable scientific workflows.**

OWL is a curated collection of reproducible, AI-adaptable scientific workflow stacks. Each OWL stack is modular, cross-platform, and designed to integrate seamlessly into both human- and AI-driven research pipelines.

This library serves as a resource for researchers, data scientists, and developers who want to:

* Build transparent, composable data analysis workflows that work across cloud platforms
* Create AI-promptable workflow stacks with natural language interfaces  
* Generate platform-agnostic execution files (CWL, Nextflow, cloud-native formats)
* Enable reproducible science through standardized, self-documenting workflow stacks

## üîç What Makes OWL Different?

**Observable**: Every workflow stack is self-describing and transparent. You can inspect what it does, how it works, and what it produces.

**Composable**: Mix and match workflow stacks like building blocks. Each OWL is designed to work independently or as part of larger pipelines through intelligent composition.

**Promptable**: Describe what you want in natural language. OWL stacks can be configured, adapted, and combined using AI-powered interfaces.

**Cross-Platform**: Generate execution-ready files for any cloud platform or workflow engine from the same source stacks.
