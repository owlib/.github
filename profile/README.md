# 🦉 Optimzed Workflow Library (OWL)

**A library of optimzed, composable, and promptable scientific workflows.**

OWL is a curated collection of reproducible, AI-adaptable scientific workflow stacks. Each OWL stack is modular, cross-platform, and designed to integrate seamlessly into both human- and AI-driven research pipelines.

This library serves as a resource for researchers, data scientists, and developers who want to:

* Build transparent, composable data analysis workflows that work across cloud platforms
* Create AI-promptable workflow stacks with natural language interfaces  
* Generate platform-agnostic execution files (CWL, Nextflow, cloud-native formats)
* Enable reproducible science through standardized, self-documenting workflow stacks

## 🔍 What Makes OWL Different?

**Observable**: Every workflow stack is self-describing and transparent. You can inspect what it does, how it works, and what it produces.

**Composable**: Mix and match workflow stacks like building blocks. Each OWL is designed to work independently or as part of larger pipelines through intelligent composition.

**Promptable**: Describe what you want in natural language. OWL stacks can be configured, adapted, and combined using AI-powered interfaces.

**Cross-Platform**: Generate execution-ready files for any cloud platform or workflow engine from the same source stacks.

## 🧠 AI-Powered Workflow Development

OWL stacks are designed to work with AI systems and provide a unified interface across all domains:

* **Consistent API**: Same interface (`from_prompt()`, `to_cwl()`, `describe()`) across all OWL stacks
* **Natural Language Configuration**: "Run quality control on RNA-seq data with standard thresholds"
* **Intelligent Composition**: Automatically combine workflows from different domains with data flow mapping
* **Adaptive Execution**: Workflows that adjust parameters based on data characteristics
* **Auto-Documentation**: Generate human-readable summaries and technical documentation

---

## 📦 What's in This Organization

* 🧬 **Domain-Specific Stacks**: `owl_genomics`, `owl_imaging`, `owl_proteomics`, `owl_metabolomics`
* 🔬 **Multi-Domain Stacks**: `owl_multiomics`, `owl_systems_biology` for integrated analyses
* 🔧 **Core Tools**: Shared composition engine, emitters, adapters, and AI interfaces
* 📚 **Templates**: Scaffolding to create your own OWL stacks
* 🌐 **Platform Adapters**: Deploy to Seven Bridges, Terra, AWS Batch, Google Cloud, and more
* 📖 **Documentation**: Best practices and examples at [workflowlibrary.org](https://workflowlibrary.org)

## 🎯 Use Cases

**For Researchers**: Use a consistent interface across all scientific domains - learn once, apply everywhere

**For Multi-Omics Scientists**: Compose workflows from different domains or use pre-curated integrated stacks

**For Platform Developers**: Integrate standardized workflows that work across multiple execution environments

**For AI Systems**: Access promptable workflow stacks with intelligent composition capabilities

**For Organizations**: Build reproducible analysis pipelines with built-in observability and cross-platform deployment

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Using Existing Stacks
```python
import owl_genomics as owl

# Consistent interface across all domains
workflow = owl.from_prompt(
    "Run RNA-seq QC with aggressive filtering for low-quality samples"
)

# Generate platform-specific execution files
cwl_file = owl.to_cwl(workflow, target_platform="seven_bridges")
```

### Composing Multiple Stacks
```python
import owl_imaging as imaging
import owl_dna_analysis as dna
from owl_core import compose

# Create individual workflows
spatial_data = imaging.from_prompt("Extract spatial coordinates from H&E images")
expression_data = dna.from_prompt("Quantify gene expression from RNA-seq")

# Intelligently compose them into a unified pipeline
combined = compose([spatial_data, expression_data])
pipeline = combined.to_cwl(target_platform="terra")
```

### Using Pre-Curated Multi-Domain Stacks
```python
import owl_multiomics as owl

# Common multi-omics patterns already integrated
workflow = owl.from_prompt("Integrate RNA-seq and imaging data for spatial transcriptomics")
```

### Creating Your Own Stack
1. Start with the [`owl-template`](https://github.com/workflow-library/owl-template)
2. Implement your workflow logic following OWL conventions
3. Add prompt templates for AI integration
4. Include emitters for your target platforms
5. Test and contribute back to the community
