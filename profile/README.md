# ðŸ¦‰ Workflow Library

Reusable, intelligent workflow specifications combining scientific methodology with computational implementation, executed through natural language interaction and optimized through community collaboration.

## What are Protocols?

**Protocols** are Git-based scientific workflow projects that encode both research methodology and computational best practices. Each protocol can be:

- **Executed** through natural language prompts
- **Adapted** intelligently based on your data characteristics
- **Optimized** through community performance insights
- **Reproduced** with full transparency and version control

## Featured Protocols

<!-- Examples - update as protocols are added -->
(coming soon)

## Getting Started

### Browse Protocols
Visit [workflowlibrary.org](https://workflowlibrary.org) to explore protocols through our web interface. (coming soon)

### Use a Protocol
```bash
# Execute via Promptable platform
promptable run rna-seq-differential-expression \
  --data "my_samples.csv" \
  --prompt "Compare treated vs control samples using human genome"
```

### Contribute a Protocol
1. Fork an existing protocol or create a new repository
2. Follow our [Protocol Structure Guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md)
3. Submit a pull request with your improvements
4. Share performance benchmarks from your validation runs
